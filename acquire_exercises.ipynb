    "- By the end of this exercise, you should have a file named acquire.py that contains the specified functions. If you wish, you may break your work into separate files for each website (e.g. acquire_codeup_blog.py and acquire_news_articles.py), but the end function should be present in acquire.py (that is, acquire.py should import get_blog_articles from the acquire_codeup_blog module.)\n",

    "#1 Codeup Blog Articles\n",
    "\n",
    "- Scrape the article text from the following pages:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - https://codeup.com/codeups-data-science-career-accelerator-is-here/\n",
    "    - https://codeup.com/data-science-myths/\n",

    "- Encapsulate your work in a function named get_blog_articles that will return a list of dictionaries, with each dictionary representing one article. The shape of each dictionary should look like this:\n",

    "- We will now be scraping text data from inshorts, a website that provides a brief overview of many different topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Write a function that scrapes the news articles for the following topics:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Business\n",
    "    - Sports\n",
    "    - Technology\n",
    "    - Entertainment\n",

    "\n",
    "- Hints:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - a. Start by inspecting the website in your browser. Figure out which elements will be useful.\n",
    "    - b. Start by creating a function that handles a single article and produces a dictionary like the one above.\n",
    "    - c. Next create a function that will find all the articles on a single page and call the function you created in the last step for every article on the page.\n",
    "    - d. Now create a function that will use the previous two functions to scrape the articles from all the pages that you need, and do any additional processing that needs to be done."
